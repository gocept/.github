# Gocept

gocept was software company from 2000 until 2023, which mainly focused on
individual software projects developed with Python. During the development we
used OSS frameworks such
as [Zope](https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope), [Plone](https://github.com/plone/),
[Pyramid](https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid), [Django](https://github.com/django/) and [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)

In case we produced potentially re-usable components, we published them as OSS
to give something back to the OSS community. During the teardown of gocept, we
archived all the packages in this organisation to mark them as no longer
maintained. In case you need to work on those packages and potentially need
release rights on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) you can contact mail@gocept.com or
the contributors of the packages and we will find a solution.
